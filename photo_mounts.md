<p>Protecting your photos, whilst displaying them, is always a challenge. To potentially help in this key area, I have designed mounting templates. They can easily be stored in clear A4 wallets and kept in a folder. Alternatively, they can be mounted within an A3 frame easily, ready to be added to your wall.</p>
<br />
<p>These templates contain the key details of the soldier's career, including: command positions held, awards obtained and campaigns fought in; they also contain military unit emblems that the person served within.</p>
<br />
<p>Each template is printed on different colour paper for each arms of service (Green for Heer, Blue for Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine, Biege for Waffen-SS). They cost an additional Â£15.00 per template. If you would like a template to go with your photo, please allow time to create each one; something that can discussed at the time of your order.</p>
